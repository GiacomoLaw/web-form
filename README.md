# Web form
A simple HTML web form. 

Check out the live demo [here](https://giacomolaw.github.io/web-form/).

> Please note that the demo form intentionally give out 405 errors. This is to prevent email spamming. It works if you host it on a standard host, but Github Pages doesn't support php.

# Installing onto your website
Download the repo. Choose which form you want, and place that form and the php file into your website public folder.

> Note that the form is designed to be a separate page, but you can imbed it if you want to.

Change the `$email_to = "youremail@mail.com";` in the [php](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/web-form/blob/master/html_form_send.php) file to your email address to get the form submissions sent to you.

Thats it! Make sure you have **both** the php file and the html file. If you have any issues, please feel free to create an issue.
